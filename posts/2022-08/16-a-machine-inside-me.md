    Have you ever had a good feeling of something inside you that makes you hyper productive? I have, and I have this feeling pretty often. Here, I will break down my recepie of hyper productivity, and this might just work for you as well.

> Off The Clock - is a time when we are all humans again

One of the reasons I chose this motto is because there's a Machine inside me. It turns its gears occasionally, and it almost seems that it's living its own life. The Machine makes me hyper productive, that's why I want to control it so much, but the mechanism is very elegant. It needs just the right amount of oil, some charge in a battery and an instruction set. How do you control this thing?

You don't. The best you can do is to create an environment for it: don't forget to lubricate its gears, charge the battery and set the right goal. Then wait and hope that it starts up. Also, don't overdo things - keep just enough lubricant in it and don't overheat the battery. Doing so will wear off the mechanism and eventually, you will have to renovate or even rebuild it completely.

Everyone has its own formula, and if you don't, you should definitely start looking for the right recipe. I will gladly share mine.

## Dopamine Oil

Dopamine is very important for focus. I learned this the hardest way possible, through dopamine deficiency. Just after my 30th birthday, I was diagnosed with ADHD, and then I learned the importance of the dopamine in the brain. I never thought about why I like certain things: coffee, food, gaming, skateboarding, music and movies, but now I clearly see that everything I did was to get a slurp of the precious dopamine. Sadly, all of this barely worked for me, so I kept doing it more and more, rapidly reaching unhealthy doses of everything, getting bored and burning out. As with everything in life, it's important to keep the balance.

Today, thanks to my diagnosis, I have medication and my Machine is lubricated better than ever. I'm still in the search of the right balance, but having a tool to manage it changes everything. I don't need to drink a dozen of coffee cups a day anymore, I stopped wasting my time gaming countless hours, I don't need music to focus. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy all these things, but the fact that I don't need them to survive makes a huge difference.

## Pull the Plug to Charge

That's right, to charge your battery, you've got to pull the plug. This might sound counterintuitive, but this is how my Machine works. It will recharge itself over time - I'm still not sure where this energy comes from, but it seems that it has a solar panel hidden somewhere, and believe me, you don't want to drain it to zero. The more charge you drain, the more time it will take to fully recharge. Please refer to my scientific chart below.

Go do other stuff. Spend some time with friends and family, visit a coffee place that you never had time to go to. Give yourself some slack and future yourself will thank you, I promise. Historically, I was able to keep the charge at about 60-100% most of the time, but I ain't perfect. I remember a day about 4 years ago when I hit rock bottom, and this was no joke. I had to undergo a battery replacement surgery and the painful process of recovery because my physical health degraded to a catastrophic level.

Today, at this moment, my charge seats at about 75%. That's not bad, but it's just enough to keep me going every week. On Fridays, it could get down to 65-70%, and when this happens, I plug my Machine off for the good part of the weekend.

## Instruction Set

Goal setting is such a boring term, that I feel disgust just typing this sentence. Why people make fun things so boring? I don't have goals - I have ambitions. While it's kind of the same thing on paper, thinking about ambitions makes me so much more inspired. Just look at this definition:

> Ambition - a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work

Just reading this gave me some chills. I am OK to work hard as long as the work is aligned with my ambitions. Everyone should have ambitions. Do you know what else everyone should have? An instruction set to reach them. Yes, that's right, I just replaced a boring term again. I enjoy planning sometimes, but I know that a lot of people hate it. Some even might think I'm a psycho, but I kindly disagree. Let me show you the basic data flow diagram that shows the ambitions pipeline.

Ambitions are actionable by definition, and to make sense out of them, you've got to actually put some work to satisfy them. The instruction set is made by asking a simple question: how do I satisfy my ambitions? What are the stepping stones that get me closer to the goal? If the ambition is a goal, and the instruction set is a plan, what is the Machine? What executes the plan?

You already know the answer. You are the Machine.
