    My first experience with Obsidian and the first post in this blog
---

How comes that I've never heard of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) before? It's such a great tool, and I've been looking for something like this for ages. I always use Markdown to mark my thoughts down (pun intended), and it has always been a random process for me. Plugin selection is really nice: git support to sync the data, Excalidraw for quick drawings, Notion-like features like databases. It all just ... makes sense.

While writing this, I realized how easy it would be to use Obsidian with GitHub Pages for blogging. But let's not get ahead of ourselves and learn some Obsidian basics. This should help me to keep writing with the least amount of friction. Signing off to learn Gatsby and set up my Obsidian vault properly.

Cheers.
