    Am I "good enough" to do this? Yes. And to kick this blog off, I declare my values in a Manifesto
---

Off The Clock is a place where I have a privilege to relax my quality standards. Here I can talk about anything, really, but since tech is the biggest of my many passions, it is likely that the content here will cover a decent portion of my professional activity.

For a long time, I've been hesitating to start my blog - I never committed to it because of my "I'm not good enough" attitude, but now, this feeling starts to fade away. There's a good reason for this, but I want to keep this topic for a dedicated post. I have things to say - that's why I'm starting this blog.

Today is the good time to declare the values of this blog, so you, dear reader, can have clear expectations from me. I call this a Manifesto, but I don't put a ton of effort in the statements, as they will most likely change over time.

## The Manifesto v0.1
* I write because I enjoy writing. My personal joy is more important than anyone's opinion
* I target 60/40 quality/speed balance. Today, consistent post schedule is more important than quality
* I am open to any feedback, but I do not promise to agree with everything
* I dedicate a portion of my personal creative time to maintain the blog
* I do my best to write in decent English, and I seek new ways to improve my writing skills
* If frequency of posts drops, it's likely that I don't have enough motivation to write, and that's totally OK
* I do not share any real persons' feelings or work performance without their permission, even in anonymized way
* I do not lie. If I am not certain about something, you will be warned, or, most likely, I will not publish such information. If I made a mistake of publishing such a thing, I'm obliged to follow up with an update post to correct it
* I expect my posts to be read by someone, eventually

Well, there it is, version 0.1 of the Off The Clock Manifesto. This small list of rules will help me to write more often. At least, this is how I feel about them at this moment. I will refine and update the Manifesto as my values shift.

So, what do you think? Is this manifesto thing useful to you as a reader? Do you think this blog is dead on arrival? Is someone even reading this? Let me know.

Until next time,  
Toly
